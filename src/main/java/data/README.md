**Note:** This README.md is here to initialize the `data` package in which our data files' paths are. Since we are not pushing prep-populated data onto our repo we were unaware that this package was not initialized. 


This is our **only** change to the repo after the submission deadline on December 8th, 2022, 11:59PM. **All code to our program was not touched after that time.**

Sorry for the inconvenience!
